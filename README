This project is designed to be a very custom timelapse application.

Design / Purpose
-	capture pictures during road trip
-	alternate between fast/slow intervals (day/night)
-	be hands free
	-	external
		-	transfer files via rsync / ssh


Long-term goals (to determine)
-	make time lapse photography simpler
	-	no need for expensive intervalometer
	-	use existing technology (n900)
	

While I would like to make an application that is flexible and not need 
re-compiled, I am thinking that this may turn into a library / extension 
/ framework so that for custom functionality (when to take pictures, 
when to stop, the algorithms can be implemented there.
